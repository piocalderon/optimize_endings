Crooked House,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The intended emotional response is shock and sadness. There's a strong character investment due to Charles's romantic involvement with Sophia and the intrigue generated by the intricate family dynamics. The ending effectively elicits emotions as the truth about Josephine and Edith's sacrifice feels earned. The shock of Edithâ€™s resolve and Josephineâ€™s cruelty strongly impacts the audience, fulfilling emotional criteria well but missing external audience reaction data."

The ending powerfully aligns with those themes, revealing the true murderer and Edith's sacrifice. The symbolic elements like Josephine's notebook and Edith's note reinforce the meaning. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway about the lengths people will go to protect family. However, Charles' lingering doubts about Edith's guilt could be clearer."
Crooked House,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending subverts expectations logically; Josephine being the killer is well-supported by her eavesdropping habit. Edith's sacrifice adds depth to the story. Foreshadowing is present, making the twist impactful and unexpected."

The audienceâ€™s reaction to an emotionally charged and conventionally fitting ending is likely positive."
Jigsaw,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"The main conflict was the Jigsaw-like game with captives. The conflict is resolved as Logan's deception is revealed, but remains ambiguous with Logan's ongoing actions. Some subplots, such as Munsen's fate, are resolved.

Symbolic elements like the traps and confessions reinforce the themes. The audience is left with a clear understanding of Logan's motives and the consequences for Halloran's actions."
Jigsaw,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,The ending subverts expectations logically by revealing Logan faked his death and was recruited by Kramer. Foreshadowing clues include Loganâ€™s previous medical background and criminal history connections. The twist adds meaning by showing the consequences of Halloranâ€™s corruption and fulfilling Kramer's ethos.
Jigsaw,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.7,"The ending of the movie follows the horror-thriller genre's typical twist ending structure well. It challenges the conventions by having an accomplice to Jigsaw revealed and framing a cop, which adds a refreshing layer. However, it may weaken the movie slightly by leaning towards melodrama. Audience expectations of a twisted and gruesome ending are mostly met, but the twist's complexity might leave some dissatisfied."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.7,"The main conflict is Tiffany and her friends encountering Derrick at Lake Derrick. This conflict is resolved when it's revealed to be a prank, except for the real chainsaw killer Derrick. Subplot resolutions include the tension between Brian, Debrah, and Tiffany being addressed. The ending feels natural albeit slightly ambiguous due to Derrick. The closure is mostly satisfying with minor unresolved elements."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.6,"The ending in Actual Output is somewhat impactful: characters face consequences for their actions, and a twist reveals a real threat. However, the emotional response is mixed, and audience investment in characters like Joe, Madea, and Tiffany is moderate. The conclusion with a blooper reel diminishes the emotional impact."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments leading to the ending are clearly identified, and the cause-and-effect relationships make sense for the most part. The ending ties back to themes of pranking and learning to co-parent. However, there are minor inconsistencies such as Joe befriending the actual Derrick that could have been better explained."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.6,"The themes in the input focus on teenage rebellion, family conflict, and attempts at teaching life lessons through pranks. The ending reveals the pranking as a lesson, which aligns somewhat with the themes, but there is a disconnect with the sudden real killer plot twist. The symbolic elements like the Grim Reaper and chainsaw killer reinforce but also create confusion, and the audience takeaway about co-parenting responsibility is somewhat clear but muddled by the horror elements."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.6,"The twist that Brian and Victor were pranking the characters was foreshadowed by the adults' suspicious behavior, adding meaning, but the actual Derrick's appearance was not fully foreshadowed and seemed less logical."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.5,"The ending challenges the typical horror-comedy genre by revealing the events as a prank, which may both enhance the movie for some and weaken it for others. Audience expectations of horror elements are subverted with a comedic twist. The movie thus fits genre conventions to a middling degree."

Happy Death Day,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending aligns well with the movie's themes of self-discovery and redemption, as Tree becomes a kinder person and resolves inner conflicts. Symbolic elements like the recurring birthday and the cupcake reinforce these themes. The audience is left with a clear takeaway about personal growth, but the actual output could delve slightly deeper into Tree's emotional transformation."
Happy Death Day,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The input sets expectations that Tombs is the killer, but the actual_output logically subverts this by revealing Lori as the real murderer. The twist is foreshadowed through Tree's repeated deaths and connections to Lori. This twist adds depth to the story by tying the motive back to Tree's relationships. The twist is surprising yet coherent, creating a mind-blowing revelation."
Happy Death Day,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),1.0,"The actual output aligns with the horror genre's typical ending structure by concluding the time loop and revealing the true killer, challenging genre conventions.

Victoria & Abdul,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The ending elicits strong emotions effectively, particularly sadness and a sense of loss. The character investment is high due to the close relationship between Victoria and Abdul. The rejection and destruction of Abdul's memories evoke intense emotions. Audience reaction data would likely support this impact."
Victoria & Abdul,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The Actual Output closely follows major plot developments from the input and maintains logical cause-and-effect relationships leading to the ending. The primary themes of Victoria's loyalty to Abdul and the court's opposition are consistent. The main inconsistency is not elaborating on Abdul's time after returning to India, reducing the score slightly."
Victoria & Abdul,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The central themes of friendship, loyalty, and cultural exchange are clearly defined. The ending aligns with these themes as Abdul remains loyal to Victoria until her death and is ultimately rejected by the court.

The audience leaves with a clear takeaway about the enduring impact of their relationship despite societal opposition."
Victoria & Abdul,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"Victoria's loyalty to Abdul subverts the expectation that she would dismiss him due to his ailment, as does her insistence on his knighthood despite opposition. Foreshadowing is present in the household's resentment and initial attempts to undermine Abdul. The twist adds emotional weight as Abdul remains loyal until her death, facing harsh repercussions after her passing."
Victoria & Abdul,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a drama/biopic and it typically ends with a reflective conclusion. The ending fits the genre conventions with a poignant resolution showing Abdul's loyalty and the aftermath of Queen Victoria's death. The ending does not break conventions significantly, adhering to audience expectations. The movie challenges the householdâ€™s prejudice but confirms the broader historical constraints, which aligns with the expected dramatic narrative."

Girls Trip,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments were identified clearly. The cause-and-effect relationships generally make sense, though Dina's role in the absinthe incident seemed a bit over-the-top. There don't appear to be major plot holes, and the ending ties back to the themes of friendship and personal growth. The coherence of the plot and character arcs is strong."
Girls Trip,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,The ending strongly reinforces the themes of friendship and empowerment. Ryan's public acknowledgment of Stewart's infidelity aligns with the theme of honesty and self-worth. The reunification of the 'Flossy Posse' and Ryan taking Sasha as a business partner provide a clear takeaway of the importance of true friends. The only minor point is the brief romantic subplot which slightly diverges from the main themes.
Girls Trip,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The story sets audience expectations with the possibility of Ryan staying with Stewart for their business deal. The twist logically subverts by Ryan revealing the truth during her speech, supported by prior foreshadowing of her internal conflict. The twist adds meaning as Ryan chooses integrity over convenience. The story is near mind-blowing but predictable in parts."
Girls Trip,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie fits the comedy-drama genre with a typical ending structure of resolution and friendship triumphing over obstacles. The ending challenges conventions slightly by having the main character reject a major relationship but enhances the movie by emphasizing personal integrity and reconnection with friends.

47 Meters Down,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"The main conflict revolves around Lisa and Kate being trapped underwater with limited air and dangerous sharks.

The hallucination element might slightly confuse some viewers, leading to a small deduction in score."
The Mummy,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"The main conflict involving Nick, Ahmanet, and Set is resolved with Nick overpowering Ahmanet.

The Mummy,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.7,"The major plot developments are consistent with the provided input, including Nick's partial possession by Set and the resurrection of Jenny.

The Mummy,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central themes encompass destiny, power, and resurrection. The ending aligns by showing Nick's struggle with destiny and choice while possessing Set's power, resurrecting Jenny. Symbolic elements like the Dagger and ancient burial reinforce meaning.

The Mummy,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The input sets up audience expectations by outlining the discovery of Ahmanet's tomb and Nick's curse, while the actual_output subverts those expectations logically with Nick using Set's powers for good. There are foreshadowing clues, such as Nick's initial resurrection and Ahmanet's retrieval of the Dagger of Set. The twist adds to the storyâ€™s meaning by exploring the duality of Nick's fate. However, the twist's impact is reduced somewhat by standard action tropes."
The Mummy,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The ending challenges genre conventions by combining horror and adventure with a darker, unresolved ending typical of horror, yet leaves open the possibility for future adventures typical of adventure films. This mix enhances the movie for fans of both genres but might not meet the expectations of those seeking a clear resolution."

Get Out,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),1.0,"The central themes of racial tension, exploitation, and the horror faced by black people are defined.

Gods of Egypt,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts expectations logically by reviving Bek and Zaya when Ra offers Horus any power. There are foreshadowing clues such as the sacrifice of Hathor and Ra's neutrality suggesting his later intervention. This twist enhances the story's meaning by showcasing Horus's realized destiny to protect. However, the revival twist and the ordaining of an afterlife based on good deeds could feel somewhat predictable."
Gods of Egypt,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The actual output fits the fantasy adventure genre's convention of a heroic resolution and the revival trope. Bringing back Bek and Zaya enhances the overall storyline, aligning well with audience expectations, but a slight deviation with Horus crowning that could be seen as less typical."

The ending fits the themes of the psychological and supernatural elements established throughout the story, concluding with Sara's death and the rescue of her sister. The score is slightly reduced due to the complexity of hallucinations which may briefly confuse the viewer."
The Forest,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The movie's central themes involve loss, the bond between siblings, and the deceptive nature of the forest. The ending aligns with these themes by showing how Sara's obsession leads to her own death, reinforcing the forest's darkness and the bond between the twins. The symbolic use of hallucinations and yÅ«rei adds depth. However, the takeaway could be clearer in relating the overall message to the audience."
The Forest,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending subverts audience expectations logically by revealing Sara's hallucinations and ultimate death, foreshadowed by her growing paranoia and visions. The twist enhances the story's depth, especially with the revelation of her fate contrasting her sister's rescue."
The Forest,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The ending fits the horror/thriller genre's typical structure of a tragic and unsettling conclusion but challenges the convention by leaving the protagonist's fate ambiguous through hallucinations.

The ending aligns with these themes as Ben is accepted by James and is commended for his actions, reinforcing his journey of proving himself. Symbolic elements like the wedding speech reinforce the theme of acceptance. The audience is left with the clear takeaway of personal growth and acceptance. However, some comedic scenes, like Ben getting thrown off the boat, slightly distract from the seriousness of the themes."
Ride Along 2,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.4,"The ending with Ben and Angela's wedding and James' acceptance of Ben slightly subverted expectations and added to the story's meaning. However, there was minimal foreshadowing for the twist with Pope and Nunez, and the twist itself didn't significantly enhance the overall plot depth."

There's no comparison of the ending with established themes and character arcs, and no rating of coherence is given. Instead, it focuses on nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age and mentions unrelated film examples."
"Hail, Caesar!",Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.1,"The actual output is a film critique from Kristen Page-Kirby that discusses nostalgia and quality of movies from Hollywood's golden age.

"Hail, Caesar!",Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.1,"The actual output provides a critique of the film's nostalgia and mentions old movies, but does not address the storyline twist or subversion elements from the provided input."
"Hail, Caesar!",Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.4,"The genre of 'Hail, Caesar!' is a comedy-drama. The film combines humor with serious undertones, which fairly matches its genre conventions.

The Divergent Series: Allegiant,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"The main conflict between Tris and the Bureau, as well as the escalating violence in Chicago, is clearly identified. The main conflict sees a resolution with the destruction of the gas dispersion hub.

The ending feels natural and complete, but some details are left open-ended."
The Divergent Series: Allegiant,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The ending elicits some effective emotions, particularly shock and a sense of closure, with Caleb's aid and Tris's message bringing resolution.

Audience reaction data is not available."
The Divergent Series: Allegiant,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments from the input are generally followed through to the actual output, including the stopping of the gas attack and conflict with David.

The ending fits the established themes of fighting against oppression and protecting Chicago's autonomy."
The Divergent Series: Allegiant,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,The ending aligns well with the central themes of genetic purity and rebellion against oppressive authorities.

The Divergent Series: Allegiant,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts expectations with David's betrayal and Peter's double-cross, supported by foreshadowing when Four becomes mistrustful of the Bureau. The twist adds depth to the story's theme of control and rebellion."
The Divergent Series: Allegiant,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The ending adheres well to the genre's (science fiction) typical structure of a climactic resolution with a significant reveal and action-packed sequences.

Get Hard,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The audience expects James to either flee the country or prepare for a tough life in prison.

The conclusion feels natural, with the band reflecting on their past during the Hall of Fame induction. However, the subplot involving Frankieâ€™s regret about his daughter feels somewhat incomplete as there is no complete closure on his emotional journey regarding her death."
Jersey Boys,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The ending elicits a mix of nostalgia and melancholy, showing the characters reflecting on their journey and what they treasure. Audience investment is achieved through Frankie's regret and emotional moments, although it lacks detailed audience reaction data."
Jersey Boys,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The actual_output provides a coherent and logical conclusion to the story by showing the members' lives years after their peak.

The sentimental end matches with the journey described in the input."
Jersey Boys,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending aligns with the central theme of the band's journey, the ups and downs they experienced, and their bond.

Jersey Boys,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts audience expectations logically with Tommy working for Joe Pesci, now an actor, and Frankie cherishing pre-success days, adding meaning. However, foreshadowing clues are minimal."
Jersey Boys,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The ending sequence involves The Four Seasons being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, fitting the biographical drama genre. The individual reflections of the band members provide a satisfying closure. Although breaking some conventions by focusing on personal reflections rather than just ending on a high note, it enhances the movie by adding depth and emotion. The audience expected a nostalgic and redemptive ending, which aligns well with the actual outcome."
The One I Love,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The central conflict of the story is Ethan and Sophie's struggle with their marriage, which is resolved once they leave the retreat. The subplot about the doppelgÃ¤ngers and their intentions finds a satisfying conclusion when Ethan and Sophie escape. The ending feels natural, showing Ethan's contemplation about Sophie's identity and his decision to accept it either way. However, the final ambiguity about Sophie's identity prevents a perfect score, as it leaves a small part of the resolution open."
The One I Love,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The ending creates emotional ambiguity about whether Ethan is with Sophie I or Sophie II, which elicits curiosity and confusion. However, it lacks character investment and effective emotional closure compared to the buildup of the story."
The One I Love,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The ending is coherent with major plot developments, including the retreat, doppelgÃ¤ngers, and Ethan's realization in the guest house. Sophie making bacon adds ambiguity about her identity, fitting established themes of trust and identity. The logical flow is maintained without discernible plot holes."
The One I Love,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central theme of resolving marital issues through unusual circumstances is well-maintained. The ending aligns with the theme of identity and change, as Ethan is left to contemplate who he's really with. Symbolic elements like the piano and bacon reinforce meaning. The audience has a clear takeaway about the complexity of relationships, though the very end leaves some ambiguity."
The One I Love,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts the audience's expectations as they escape the estate and seek answers, but the foreshadowing about Sophie cooking bacon and Ethanâ€™s clothing are logical clues supporting this twist. The twist adds to the storyâ€™s meaning by exploring whether Sophie and Ethan have changed or not. However, the conclusion at the therapistâ€™s office was predictable."
The One I Love,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,The ending challenges genre conventions but still emphasizes the core relationship conflict; audience-response aligned well with Ethan's acceptance of Sophie regardless of her true identity.
Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.7,"The main conflict is Nancy's quest for revenge against Roark. The conflict is resolved with Roark's death. Subplots related to Marv, Johnny, and Dwight have mixed resolutions, some complete and others less so. The ending, involving Nancy and Marv, is complete but feels slightly contrived with Hartigan's ghostly intervention."
Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The ending evokes strong emotions of revenge and justice, which feels earned. However, some subplots and character connections may be less impactful without further context. The investment in Nancy's struggle and her decisive actions engage the audience effectively."
Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The actual output aligns with major plot developments like Marv aiding Nancy, her confrontation with Roark, and the theme of vengeance.

Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The themes of revenge and vengeance are consistent throughout, and the ending aligns with those themes as Nancy achieves her revenge with help from Marv and Hartigan's ghost.

The Two Faces of January,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments leading to the ending such as Chester's crimes, Colette's death, and Rydal's actions are consistent. The cause-and-effect relationship holds as Chester's and Rydal's actions logically follow from their characters. However, there is a slight inconsistency at the end where Chester dies in Istanbul, differing from the expected twist of Chester potentially reporting Rydal at the airport."
The Two Faces of January,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The central themes of deception and betrayal in the movie are reinforced by Chester's deathbed confession and Rydal's reflection at the grave. Symbolism, such as Colette's bracelet, strengthens the meaning. The audience is left with a clear takeaway on the consequences of deceit. However, the final actions could potentially be seen as slightly rushed."
The Two Faces of January,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The ending subverts expectations logically with Chester's death and confession facilitated by Rydal. Foreshadowing includes Chester's distrust and violence, hinting at a dire resolution. The twist enriches the narrative by resolving Chester's crimes and Rydal's moral dilemma."
The Two Faces of January,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The ending in the actual output maintains the thriller genre by fitting the typical structure of a tense resolution.

Laggies,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The ending follows most major plot developments and cause-and-effect relationships, with Megan breaking up with her boyfriend and confronting Craig about their relationship.

Themes of self-discovery and honesty are consistent, and there are no significant plot holes or inconsistencies."
Laggies,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The movie's central themes of self-discovery and honesty are reinforced by the ending. Megan breaks away from her past, pursues genuine relationships, and takes responsibility for her actions. Symbolic elements like the prom and the final note to Craig enhance the themes, providing a clear takeaway for the audience."
Laggies,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts the audience's expectation of a typical romantic resolution by having Megan break up with her fiancÃ© and risk reconnecting with Craig in an uncertain manner. The foreshadowing clues, such as Megan's dissatisfaction with her life and the mounting tension, support the twist and add complexity to the storyâ€™s meaning."
Laggies,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a romantic dramedy and the ending meets genre expectations by providing resolution through the main character's growth and new relationships.

The Homesman,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"The main conflict of escorting the women to Iowa is resolved, and Briggs takes them to Hebron. Subplots involving the women's issues are addressed but not deeply concluded. The ending is mostly complete, with Briggs's actions after Cuddy's death and his proposal to Tabitha adding closure, though some ambiguity remains around Briggs's true emotions."
The Homesman,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.9,The intended emotional response of sadness and shock is clear from Mary Bee's suicide. The audience is invested in her character and feels her despair. The ending with Briggs carrying guilt and the marker being kicked feels earned and elicits strong emotions. Reviews could confirm this impact.
The Homesman,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The plot developments are logically connected with actions leading to clear consequences, and consistent character arcs, particularly with Briggs feeling guilty about rejecting Cuddy and trying to memorialize her. However, there is a slight inconsistency with the ending message's tone, as Briggs proposes to Tabitha despite his disdain for the western territories, potentially clashing with the established theme of loneliness and hardship."
The Homesman,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central themes include isolation, survival, and the harshness of pioneer life. The ending aligns with these themes, showing Briggs's guilt and the continued hardships faced. Symbolic elements, such as Mary Bee's marker being kicked into the river, reinforce the harsh reality. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway about the difficulties of frontier life, but the abrupt transition to Briggs's proposal to Tabitha slightly weakens the theme reinforcement."
The Homesman,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"Before the ending, audience expects Briggs to continue west with his rowdy song suggesting freedom, but the twist logically subverts this by him proposing to Tabitha. Foreshadowing includes Briggs' guilt and his actions towards Tabitha. The twist adds depth by contrasting Briggs' rejection of western life with his advice for Tabitha."
The Homesman,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie's genre, likely western drama, typically ends with either a hopeful resolution or a tragic but meaningful conclusion. The ending fits the genre conventions by showing the harsh realities of the west, though Briggs' proposal to a new woman may slightly challenge expectations. This enhances the movie by highlighting his complex character and the unchanging brutality of frontier life. Audience expectations of a realistic, somber finale are met, though the lack of a clear resolution for the women's fate may slightly affect response."
Inherent Vice,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.6,"The main conflict about finding Mickey and investigating the Golden Fang is resolved except for the exact fates of Coy and Shasta.

Inherent Vice,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.4,"The emotional response aimed for confusion and intrigue but was only partly achieved. Character investment is moderate since the audience may care about Coy and Shasta, although the ending feels abrupt and not entirely earned. There are no audience reaction data cited to support emotional impact."
Inherent Vice,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.7,"The major plot developments are generally consistent between the input and the actual output. The cause-and-effect relationships also mostly make sense, and there are no significant plot holes. However, there are slight inconsistencies, such as the role and fate of characters like Glen Charlock and the involvement of Adrian Prussia. The ending involving Doc and Shasta also connects to established themes and character arcs, but the coherence between the finer details could be improved."
Inherent Vice,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central themes of investigation and corruption are consistent throughout and resolved at the end with Doc navigating these challenges. Symbolic elements like the Golden Fang reinforce the narrative. However, the final takeaway is somewhat ambiguous as Doc and Shasta's destination remains unknown."
Inherent Vice,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"Audience expects Doc to solve the cases logically; the twist reveals more corruption with Adrian Prussia and Bigfoot's betrayal, which subverts expectations. Foreshadowing includes corrupt elements and Doc being drugged. The twist enhances the noir theme."
Inherent Vice,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The actual output fits the genre (crime/mystery) by resolving plot threads including the fates of Coy, Shasta, and the Golden Fang.

If I Stay,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The ending logically follows the plot development. Mia's flashbacks and interactions with Adam culminate in her ultimate decision, which aligns with her character arc and the story's themes. The cause-and-effect relationships are well maintained, with Adam's appearance influencing Mia's choice. There are no significant plot holes, and the resolution with Juilliard connects back to established events. However, a perfect score is withheld as the leap from Mia's desire to join her deceased family to her final choice could use slightly clearer articulation."
If I Stay,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending aligns with the central themes of love, music, and the decision to live or die. Symbolic elements, such as the cello music and Adam's letter from Juilliard, reinforce the meaning. The audience is left with a clear takeaway of Mia's choice to stay and fight for her life."
If I Stay,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.6,"The story sets expectations of Mia possibly dying, but foreshadowing through her passion for music and relationship with Adam supports her survival. The twist that she lives is meaningful but predictable given her bond with Adam and the music."
If I Stay,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The genre is drama/romance, which often ends with emotional resolutions. The ending fits conventions by showing Mia's emotional choice to live, influenced by love and future aspirations.

"Lost Medallion: The Adventures of Billy Stone, TheThe Lost Medallion: The Adventures of Billy Stone",Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The intended emotional response is adventure and resolution, and the character investment is moderate as Billy and Allie face challenges.

"Lost Medallion: The Adventures of Billy Stone, TheThe Lost Medallion: The Adventures of Billy Stone",Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is of the adventure genre with a typical structure involving a quest and resolution. While it mostly follows conventional genre expectations, it slightly diverges with a religious message at the end.

2 Guns,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"The main conflict involves the heist and the aftermath of discovering the unexpected amount of money. This conflict is resolved with a shootout where various factions, including the CIA operative Earl, Quince, and the criminals, clash with Bobby and Stig ultimately surviving. Some subplots, such as Bobbyâ€™s relationship with Deb, are not fully resolved, especially since Deb is killed. The ending feels mostly natural but leaves room for continuation, as Bobby and Stig plan to take down other CIA secret banks."
2 Guns,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The intended emotional response seems to be a mix of shock and satisfaction. The characters Bobby and Stig have clear emotional investment, especially with the betrayals and the loss of Deb.

2 Guns,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central themes of trust and betrayal are clearly defined and reinforced. The ending with Bobby revealing the hidden money aligns well as a continuation of the movie's themes, with symbolic elements such as the scattered money and the standoff. The clear takeaway is about uncovering deeper corruption within the system."

Foreshadowing with Earl's aggressive inquiries and Quince's disloyal actions supports the twist. The twist adds meaning by exposing corruption, although it may not be entirely mind-blowing."
2 Guns,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a crime/action genre, which typically ends with resolution via confrontation or escape. The ending fits genre conventions with a massive shootout and betrayal resolution. It does challenge conventions slightly by planning to continue against the CIA. This breaking of conventions adds complexity, potentially enhancing the movie. Audience expectations for crime action movies involve intense confrontations, which this ending provides effectively."

The conflict is resolved in the Final Round where Nick defeats Heller and escapes with Sarah. Subplots about Tommy and the initial accident are also resolved. The ending is complete as it concludes naturally, but the resolution could have been presented more cohesively."
12 Rounds 2: Reloaded,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The intended emotional response is shock and suspense, which is effectively maintained throughout. The audience is invested in Nick's struggle, and by the end, the emotions feel earned. The storyline has some gaps which might affect audience reviews."

There are foreshadowing clues like the calling card tattoo and the boy from the first accident supporting the twist. The twist adds to the storyâ€™s meaning by revealing the motivation behind Hellerâ€™s actions and the connection to the first accident.

Emperor,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,The ending subverts expectations logically by exonerating the Emperor despite the anticipation of a trial. Foreshadowing is evident through discussions of the Emperorâ€™s ceremonial role and influence in ending the war. The twist adds depth by focusing on post-war reconstruction rather than punishment.
Emperor,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The ending mostly fits the wartime drama genre, resolving major conflicts and emphasizing historical accuracy. However, the lack of conclusive evidence and the Emperor's voluntary offer of punishment could be seen as slightly unconventional elements.

The subplot of Amanda and Winslow's attempts to help Marybeth is concluded with their deaths. The ending leaves some ambiguity regarding Marybeth's fate, but overall provides a natural conclusion to the primary storyline."
Hatchet III,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The ending elicits emotional response effectively, particularly shock and resolution as Marybeth finally defeats Victor Crowley, but the character investment may be moderate given her disinterest in Amanda's help. Audience's reaction data and detailed emotional impact rate are missing."
Hatchet III,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments and character arcs are resolved coherently. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the cyclical nature of Victor's resurrection stretches believability. The thematic resolution of using ashes to defeat Victor aligns well. Minor plot inconsistencies are present, but they do not majorly detract from the narrative flow."
Hatchet III,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central theme involves Victor's desire for his father's ashes and his relentless return. The ending aligns with themes as Victor is ultimately killed with his father's ashes. Symbolism is present with the ashes. The audience gets a clear takeaway of the finality of Victor's death but is left uncertain about Marybeth's fate, which slightly detracts from complete clarity."
Hatchet III,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts audience expectations by having Marybeth seemingly kill Victor Crowley once and for all but leaves her fate uncertain. There are clues throughout the film about the â€˜repeaterâ€™ nature of Victor Crowley and the significance of his fatherâ€™s ashes, which support the twist. The twist adds dramatic meaning to Marybethâ€™s struggle. The twist is surprising yet logical due to the foreshadowing."
Hatchet III,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.7,"The ending maintains the horror genre's expectation of the antagonist being difficult to kill, providing a satisfying and climactic confrontation.

The ending fits genre conventions by focusing on emotional resolution and intimacy between Dodge and Penny, rather than survival, which aligns with the genre's tendency to highlight human connections in the face of disaster. While it challenges the typical hopeful ending of many romance films, this enhances the movie's impact as it provides a poignant and fitting conclusion to their story. Audience expectations of a love resolution are met, even if the ending is bittersweet."
Silent House,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The main conflict of Sarah's traumatic past and the abuses is addressed. The input and output align well in resolving the main conflict and explaining her mental state. There are some ambiguities towards the ending about Sarah's future, but the main and subplots are concluded."
Silent House,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.9,"The story effectively elicits emotions of shock and horror, and there is significant character investment in Sarah's traumatic experiences. The ending feels earned with Sarah exacting revenge on her abusers, and it ties into her dissociative identity disorder. User reactions on review sites would further support the impact."
Silent House,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The events and cause-and-effect relationships largely make sense, with Sarah's traumatic experiences leading to her violent actions. There is a clear coherence to the plot developments and Sarah's dissociative identity disorder. It provides a logical ending that aligns with established themes of trauma and revenge. The realization of Sarah being the intruder is consistent, but some minor questionable elements like the sudden reappearance of the uncle without clear explanation could reduce coherence slightly."
Silent House,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The themes of childhood trauma and repressed memories are clear. The ending, where Sarah confronts and kills her father, aligns with her reclaiming control. Symbolic elements like hallucinations reinforce the theme. The takeaway about the effects of abuse is given clearly across the story."
Silent House,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending logically subverts audience expectations set by the earlier text, using foreshadowing (hallucinations) and builds on the story's meaning of repressed trauma and dissociative identity disorder. The twist about Sarah being the 'intruder' is well-supported, though slightly predictable given the hints."
Silent House,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie is a psychological horror, and the ending reveals the twist that Sarah is both the victim and the perpetrator which fits the genre's conventions of psychological twists. Although the ending reveals Sarah's struggles with her past and mental health, it does slightly break from typical horror endings by focusing heavily on psychological trauma, enhancing the movie. Audience expectations for horror are met with a deeply unsettling conclusion about Sarah's true nature and the horrors she endured."

Kill the Irishman,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.9,"The intended emotional response is shock and sadness, clearly felt with Greene's death. Character investment is high as Greene is developed thoroughly. The ending elicits emotions effectively, feeling earned given Greene's criminal past. Audience reaction data isn't provided, but it seems deeply impactful."
Kill the Irishman,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The plot developments lead logically to Greene's assassination and tie up major events and character arcs, such as Greene's defiance towards the Mafia and his ultimate acceptance of his fate. The ending is consistent with the established themes and outcomes for the characters, especially Greene. However, the sudden collapse of the Mafia in the epilogue might feel slightly rushed."
Kill the Irishman,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,The actual output aligns closely with the central themes of Danny Greene's fight against the Mafia and his eventual downfall. The symbolic gesture of giving the necklace to the boy reinforces Greeneâ€™s character and legacy. The epilogue provides a clear takeaway by showing the broader impact of Greene's death on the Mafia.
Kill the Irishman,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,Audience expected Greene to make a final stand. The ending logically subverts this by showing Greene's acceptance of his fate. Foreshadowing includes Detective Manditski warning Greene about a master killer. The twist adds to the storyâ€™s meaning by showing Greene's final act of kindness and the subsequent Mafia collapse.
Kill the Irishman,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie is a crime drama where the protagonist meets a violent end, fitting genre conventions. The ending of Greene's death and the collapse of the Mafia aligns with audience expectations and adds closure. However, it slightly underplays the build-up to the final confrontation, hence not a perfect score."
Abduction,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The main conflict involving Nathan discovering his true identity and evading Kozlow is clearly resolved with Kozlow's death and Burton's arrest. Nathan's personal struggles and relationships have satisfying conclusions, particularly his newfound bond with Karen. Some ambiguity is left regarding Martin's presence in Nathan's life, but the closure feels natural."
Abduction,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The ending elicits emotions effectively as Nathan's father kills Kozlow and justice is served while Nathan starts a new life with Karen. The audience is invested in Nathan's journey and the resolution feels earned. Character development and tension maintain audience interest. However, there's no explicit mention of audience reaction data."
Abduction,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The plot developments lead coherently to the ending and there's a logical cause-and-effect relationship for Nathan confronting Kozlow. However, Burton's capture seemed too convenient and quickly resolved. The ending is consistent with the character arcs, but some minor aspects, such as the ease of Martin killing Kozlow, reduce the score."
Abduction,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central themes of identity, family secrets, and protection are defined and the ending aligns with these themes as Nathan learns more about his true parentage and takes control of his life. The symbolic elements, such as the safehouse and encrypted list, reinforce the significance of Nathan's identity and parental protection. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway of Nathan's journey towards self-discovery and overcoming threats. While the theme is powerfully reinforced, some aspects of the CIA corruption and Martin's distance could be depicted more strongly."
Abduction,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,The twist that Nathan's biological father Martin ends up killing Kozlow subverts expectations logically and is well-foreshadowed by Dr. Bennett's background and Martin's mysterious actions. The twist adds meaning by resolving Nathan's search for identity but could be slightly more surprising.
Abduction,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a thriller which typically ends with a resolution of the mystery or danger. The ending follows genre conventions by resolving the primary conflict of Kozlow's threat and revealing the corrupt CIA operative, Burton. The genre's expectations of high stakes and intense action are met. Breaking the convention slightly with Nathan's father Martin's continued absence may enhance the mystery, though it could leave some viewers wanting more closure."
The Change-Up,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The main conflict of Mitch and Dave switching bodies and needing to switch back is resolved. The subplot resolutions, such as Mitch improving his relationship with Dave's family and work, and Dave flirting with Sabrina, are satisfying. The ending is complete, with a natural return to their original bodies. However, it is slightly ambiguous whether Mitch has fully matured."
The Change-Up,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The story effectively elicits emotions such as humor, awkwardness, and ultimately satisfaction with the switch-back resolution. The characters' investments are depicted clearly as they navigate their swapped lives, leading to an ending that feels earned. Audience reactions (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, reviews) data is absent but assuming mainstream appeal, the impact is substantial."
The Change-Up,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments lead logically to the ending, with the switch back occurring after trying to urinate in the fountain again. Events make sense and follow a clear cause-and-effect trajectory. There are minor inconsistencies such as the unrealistic continuation of body swap effects after failing on the first try and the improbability of security arriving so conveniently, but no major plot holes. The ending aligns with the established themes and character arcs, emphasizing personal growth and relationships."
The Change-Up,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending aligns with the themes of self-discovery and personal growth. Symbolic elements like the fountain and body-switch reinforce the meaning.

The Change-Up,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The ending provides logical subversion by switching the characters back, supported by their realizations and actions, such as Mitch's respect for Dave and Dave's appreciation for Mitch. The foreshadowing with the fountain and their interactions adds depth to the twist, making it meaningful, though somewhat predictable."
The Change-Up,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie is a comedy with a body-swap theme, and the ending adheres to this genre's conventions by resolving the body swap and providing a humorous resolution. The epilogue and post-credits scene add comedic elements, which align with audience expectations. However, the inclusion of the unconventional elements like Mitch giving a speech at his father's wedding adds a slight deviation."
Contagion,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The main conflict of a virus outbreak and its impact on society is well defined. The conflict is resolved with the creation of a vaccine and the gradual control of the outbreak. Subplots such as Mitch and Jory's survival, Dr. Mears' death, and Krumwiedeâ€™s conspiracy are also resolved. The ending feels complete with details on the containment and source of the virus. However, the provided actual output adds extra information on the virus origin rather than summarizing the ending, slightly impacting the closure assessment."
Contagion,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The actual output effectively reveals the origin of the virus, which is shocking and novel; however, it doesn't discuss the emotional responses, investment in characters, or audience reactions. The ending is conclusive yet lacks information on reviews or deeper direct emotional impacts."
Contagion,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The input outlines major plot developments and characters' actions coherently align with the cause-and-effect relationships, resulting in the virus spread and efforts to control it.

Contagion,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie 'Contagion' is a thriller about a virus outbreak. The ending explains the origin of the virus, fitting the genre by providing a conclusive explanation and tying up loose ends. The detailed and realistic resolution aligns well with genre expectations, enhancing the movie. The audience response is positive due to this closure. It fulfills most conventions but slightly lacks dramatic finality typical in some thrillers."
From Prada to Nada,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"The main conflicts are mostly resolved: Gabe reconnects with his half-sisters, Mary admits her feelings for Bruno, and Nora and Edward get engaged. However, the subplot involving Rodrigo ends abruptly with Mary's car accident without a clear resolution for his character. The conclusion feels natural but leaves some ambiguity."
From Prada to Nada,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The emotional response intended is joy and reconciliation. The audience is invested in the sistersâ€™ outcomes, particularly their romantic and personal growth. The ending feels earned as it resolves key plot points, but it lacks some emotional punch due to the quick wrap-up of Maryâ€™s accident and Gabeâ€™s subplot. Limited audience reaction data referenced."
From Prada to Nada,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments leading to the ending match well, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical. Both Nora and Mary find love, tying their arcs to family and self-discovery themes. However, Gabe's reaction to his split with Olivia feels unaddressed, presenting a minor inconsistency."
From Prada to Nada,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The movie's central themes of family, self-discovery, and love are reinforced in the ending. The symbolic elements, such as the letters and the wheelchair ramp, enhance the message. The audience leaves with the clear takeaway that personal growth and genuine connections matter. The only slight issue is the abrupt resolution of Gabe and Olivia's relationship."
From Prada to Nada,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending meets audience expectations for romance resolutions, but adds a slight twist with Gabe's split. Foreshadowing is sufficient with Bruno's care for Mary. The twist enriches the story's themes of family and love."
From Prada to Nada,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The film's ending fits the romantic comedy genre with resolution and happy endings for characters, aligning well with genre expectations. The break-up with Rodrigo and the reconciliation between sisters add depth without weakening the film."
I Am Number Four,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The main conflict with the Mogadorians is resolved with their defeat, and subplots such as Mark's repentance and Sam's search for his father have conclusions.

I Am Number Four,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The story elicits a strong sense of adventure and tension with the Mogadorians hunting John and the other Garde.

Minor points are deducted for the slightly agitated Mark, whose final sentiment seems somewhat abrupt."
I Am Number Four,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central themes of the movie include survival, protection, and unity against a common enemy. The ending aligns with these themes by showing John and Number Six teaming up to find other survivors and protect Earth. Symbolic elements like the blue rocks reinforce the connection amongst the Garde and their mission. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway of hope and unity. The slight deduction is due to Mark's mixed feelings at the end, which somewhat clouds the unified resolution."
I Am Number Four,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The ending adds meaning by showing John's determination to protect Earth and find Sam's father, which aligns with the story's goals. The twist with Mark lying to help John and the use of the blue rocks subverts expectations logically. However, the foreshadowing about the significance of the blue rocks and Mark's change of heart could be clearer."
I Am Number Four,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie is a science fiction genre with a typical ending structure involving the protagonist uniting with allies to face a common enemy. The ending fits genre conventions by showcasing unity, preparation for future battles, and emotional closure.

The cause-and-effect relationships made sense, and there were no significant plot holes. The resolution with Katherine and Danny's love was consistent with their character arcs. However, the sudden appearance of Andy Roddick as Palmer's new love interest was slightly abrupt."
Just Go with It,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The movie's central themes of love, deception, and personal growth are reinforced by the ending where Danny and Katherine, who have been deceptive, ultimately find true love. Symbolic elements like the wedding ring and the Hawaiian setting support this. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway about honesty and real love."
Just Go with It,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts the initial expectation that Danny would end up with Palmer, but is logical given the developing relationship with Katherine. There are foreshadowing clues, such as their close friendship and mutual admiration. However, the twist is somewhat predictable once Danny and Katherine's connection deepens."
Just Go with It,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a romantic comedy, which typically ends with the main couple getting together. The ending adheres to this genre convention as Danny and Katherine, the real couple, end up together. However, it diverges slightly by introducing a subplot about Palmer quickly moving on with someone else. This twist is unconventional but does not severely detract from the genre fit, and the inclusion likely aims to elicit a positive reaction from the audience."
Happy Feet Two,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The main conflict of freeing the trapped emperor penguins is resolved with the help of Bryan and the elephant seals. Subplots such as Erik finding his calling by using his singing abilities, Ramon and Carmen's love story, and the krill's journey are satisfactorily concluded. The ending feels natural and complete, with the emperor penguins being freed and reunited. There was a slight ambiguity regarding the fate of Sven, therefore it is not a full resolution."

Happy Feet Two,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The major plot developments lead logically to the ending. Cause-and-effect relationships are well maintained, and there are no apparent plot holes or inconsistencies.

However, some predictability remains as help was expected."
Happy Feet Two,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The ending fits adequately within the genre conventions of animated family films by having a happy and triumphant resolution, aligning well with audience expectations.

Madea's Big Happy Family,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.5,"The intended emotional response is mixed, combining sadness with elements of humor. While the audience may invest in Shirley's outcome, the actual ending feels jarring and undercuts the emotional buildup with a comedic twist. There might be conflicting audience reactions due to the tonal shift."

Madea's Big Happy Family,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending surprises the audience with a comedic twist on The Maury Povich Show. This twist logically subverts the serious tone set by Shirley's death and familial conflicts. There is foreshadowing with the blood type reveal, though the show's non-canon note slightly undermines its impact. The twist adds humor but doesn't deeply enhance the story's overall meaning."

No Strings Attached,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The emotional response intended is joy and fulfillment, and the ending mostly elicits these feelings effectively.

Our Idiot Brother,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),1.0,"The central theme of Ned bringing positive change to his sisters' lives through his honesty and innocence is well aligned with the ending, where the sisters have all improved their lives and Ned has found new purpose. Symbolic elements like the dog 'Willie Nelson' signify trust and loyalty, reinforcing the theme.

Our Idiot Brother,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts expectations logically as Ned opening a candle shop is unexpected but supported by his love for simple life. Foreshadowing was present as his character consistently showed a desire for happiness.

Spy Kids: All the Time in the World,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The twist that Danger is the Time Keeper is logically foreshadowed by his watch and name. The twist adds to the storyâ€™s meaning by exploring the themes of time and family, fulfilling audience expectations with a satisfying and cohesive conclusion.

Sucker Punch,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.7,"The main conflict is clearly identified, and the central resolution involving Babydoll's sacrifice and Sweet Pea's escape is shown.

Subplots like Rocket's sacrifice and Blue's arrest are resolved satisfyingly."
Sucker Punch,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.4,Intended emotional response mainly was shock and sadness. Character investment was moderate due to limited audience connection with Babydoll. Ending is emotionally effective but feels somewhat contrived. Audience reaction data shows mixed reviews.
Sucker Punch,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.6,"While the deleted scene about Sweet Pea stealing clothes and the High Roller's conversation with Babydoll contribute to character arcs and themes, it adds new elements rather than resolving the core storylines.

Sucker Punch,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The actual output aligns with the film's central themes of sacrifice and freedom, symbolized by Babydoll's willingness to give herself. The ending reinforces the theme but introduces a new element involving the High Roller, adding depth to Babydoll's final sacrifice. The audience has a clear takeaway, though the symbolic nuance slightly diverges from the original plot."
Sucker Punch,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,The ending sequence where Babydoll's willingness leads to her fantasy ending and the real world resuming subverts audience expectations in a logical way and adds to the storyâ€™s meaning by highlighting her quest for freedom.

Sucker Punch,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.4,"The actual output introduces a significant change in the ending. Instead of BabyDollâ€™s sacrifice facilitating Sweet Peaâ€™s escape, the focus shifts to a moment with the High Roller.

Zookeeper,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie follows the comedy/romantic-comedy genre ending structure where the protagonist wins in love and finds a happy resolution. The ending fits genre conventions by having Griffin refuse Stephanie and confess his love for Kate, which is an expected conclusion. However, Griffin stopping to beat up Shane introduces a slightly unconventional twist that might challenge some genre conventions, but it generally enhances the movie. Audience expectations for a happy, romantic resolution are met."

Kick-Ass,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending ties back to the central themes of vigilantism, personal empowerment, and revenge. The protagonists resolve to defeat the main antagonist, effectively closing the narrative arc. Symbolic elements like the jet pack with miniguns reinforce the fantastical and comic book-inspired tone. The audience is left with a clear takeaway about the consequences of vigilante justice. The score is slightly reduced due to potential thematic excess with the use of a bazooka."
Kick-Ass,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending subverts expectations logically, with Dave using a jet pack and a bazooka.

Kick-Ass,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie is a superhero action-comedy which typically ends with the hero defeating the villain. The ending fits genre conventions strongly with the over-the-top action fight and the main villains' defeat. Deviations like Kick-Ass using a bazooka add to the comic book feel rather than detract.

Charlie St. Cloud,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The audience expects Tess to be a spirit like Sam, but the twist reveals she is actually alive. There were foreshadowing clues such as Tess's injury and the 'come find me' note. The twist deepens the story's emotional impact and meaning."
Charlie St. Cloud,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie is a supernatural romance drama, which typically has emotional and bittersweet endings. The actual output fits the genre conventions with Charlie finding closure and setting off with Tess, enhancing the film with Charlie's emotional growth.

Going the Distance,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.6,"The ending subverts the expectation that Erin and Garrett would permanently separate, logically leading to another chance at their relationship, supported by foreshadowing of Garrett's dissatisfaction with his job. The twist adds complexities to their story, although some elements are predictable and the reunion slightly diminishes the emotional impact of their earlier parting."
Going the Distance,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a romantic comedy and the ending is typical for the genre. The protagonists have a chance at rekindling their relationship, aligning with audience expectations. While the film playfully breaks some conventions, such as the running joke and awkward situations, it enhances the overall comedic and romantic elements. The ending fits well within genre conventions, but the slightly unconventional elements lower the score a bit."
The Karate Kid,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.4,"The main conflict between Dre and Cheng is resolved in the tournament, but the additional scene of Li attacking Cheng diverges from the original and adds complexity. The subplot with Dre's mother isn't properly concluded, and the ending feels a bit disjointed with Sherry punching Li."
The Karate Kid,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.4,"The intended emotional response is somewhat addressed, but the actual output introduces new elements that weren't built up, like Sherry's punch. Mr. Han's role is consistent, yet doesn't fully encapsulate the investment built in Dre's story."
The Karate Kid,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.4,"The actual output adds a fight between Han and Li not found in the original input and deviates from Cheng awarding Dre the trophy. However, it maintains the overall theme of Dre earning respect and the Fighting Dragons' acceptance of Mr. Han as their master."
The Karate Kid,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.5,"The ending supports some themes, such as overcoming adversity and respect, but deviates with Sherry and Li's confrontation which does not align with the core themes and feels unnecessary."
The Karate Kid,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.5,"The actual output changes the ending with an additional fight between Han and Li and Sherry's brief retaliation, which subverts expectations logically. However, it lacks foreshadowing and adds less to the story's meaning compared to the original ending where respect is mutually earned."
The Karate Kid,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.6,"The genre is martial arts drama, typically with a heroic and redemptive ending. The actual output alters the convention by adding more violence and conflict post-tournament, detracting from the genre's usual inspirational conclusion. It challenges genre conventions and slightly weakens the movie by including additional unnecessary aggression."
Killers,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,The main conflict (Spencer wanting to leave his assassin life and threats resulting from it) is resolved with Spencer proving his intention and making peace with Jen's father.

Killers,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.5,"The intended emotional response is mixed but leans towards relief and closure. Character investment is moderate due to ongoing conflicts and tension. The ending somewhat elicits emotions as it attempts to provide resolution and peace. Audience reaction data isn't provided, affecting the final score."
Killers,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The ending ties up major plot developments and resolves key conflicts. Events generally make sense without major plot holes, but a few elements like the sudden peace and Spencer's moustache lack deeper explanation."
Killers,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,The movieâ€™s central theme of balancing normal life and secret agent duties is aligned with the ending where Spencer proves he is out of the game and the family builds trust. Symbolic elements include Spencer's moustache and the lasers protecting the baby. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway of family unity and trust.
Killers,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts audience expectations as Jen's father, a seemingly regular dad, turns out to be the one who put out the bounty on Spencer. This twist is supported by subtle foreshadowing, such as his suspicion and knowledge of Spencer's past. The twist adds depth to the story's meaning, revealing family dynamics and hidden pasts. However, some elements like Spencer's sudden confession add a touch of predictability."
Killers,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.7,The ending fits the action-comedy genre by resolving conflicts and adding humor but stretches believability and genre conventions with laser-protected crib and an overdone comedic twist.
Repo Men,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.7,"The main conflict involving Remy's change in allegiance is clearly resolved with him attempting to free himself and others from debt. The conclusion is somewhat ambiguous with Remy in a coma, but it ties back to the central conflict. The subplots involving Carol, Peter, and Beth reach satisfying narratives but are interwoven into the main resolution."
Repo Men,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The intended emotional response seems to be a mix of tension, sadness, and a bittersweet realization, which is effectively communicated. The audience becomes invested in Remy's plight and his struggle against the oppressive company. The ending, revealing Remy's coma and virtual existence, feels earned given the twists and Remy's journey. There are reviews and audience reactions that generally appreciate the twist. However, some parts may feel slightly predictable, impacting the emotional depth."
Repo Men,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,Major plot developments in input lead reasonably to the ending but there are minor inconsistencies with Jake's motivations and actions. The coma twist explains the illogical parts but is a minor plot hole in that it seems partly unearned.
Repo Men,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The film's central theme of exploitation and the moral implications of human commodification is strongly aligned with the ending. The final scene symbolically represents Remy's escape from reality to a peaceful dream world, fitting the theme. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway about the cost of dehumanization, and the ending powerfully reinforces this message, with a slight deduction for the abrupt closure on Jake's character."
Repo Men,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,The twist is highly unexpected but logical within the story. Remy's coma and computer-generated dream world subverts the expectation of their escape. Foreshadowing clues include the malfunctioning defibrillator and the extreme measures to erase their accounts. The twist significantly adds to the story's meaning by highlighting the consequences of their actions and exploring the permanence of debt.
Repo Men,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.5,"The movie fits within the sci-fi genre, typically involving dystopian futures and complex technological landscapes. However, the ending challenges conventional genre expectations by introducing a twist that weakens the narrative, making it feel less cohesive compared to the buildup. Audience expectations for a genre-defined resolution might feel mismatched due to the drastic shift."

Stone,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The major plot developments and character arcs are consistently followed, and events have logical cause-and-effect relationships. The ending ties back to several established themes, such as Jack's struggle with faith and morality. The only minor issues lie in slightly ambiguous motivations of Stone and Lucetta at the end, but it doesn't significantly impact coherence."
Stone,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The ending aligns well with the movie's central themes of control, redemption, and existential questioning. The symbolic elements, such as the buzzing bee, add layers of meaning, and the audience is left with a clear takeaway about the cyclical nature of behavior and the question of whether people can truly change. However, there is a slight drop in how powerfully the final scenes reinforce these themes, and some symbolic elements could have been tied together more explicitly."
Stone,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"Audience initially expects Jack to remain a stoic, harsh parole officer and loyal husband despite early dark hints. The ending subverts expectations as it reveals Jack's destructive tendencies and internal struggles logically. The twist is well-supported with recurring themes, buzzing sounds, and character dialogues, adding depth to Jack's character and the story's meaning."
Stone,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie falls into the drama/thriller genre, typically characterized by complex characters and psychological tension, often resolving with a thought-provoking or morally ambiguous ending. The ending follows this pattern but with a unique twist â€“ Jack's spiritual dilemma and Stone's ambiguous transformation. The breaking of conventions, such as the protagonist's lack of redemption or clear resolution, adds depth but might not align perfectly with all audience expectations. The audience's response to the unconventional ending might be mixed, reflecting both intrigue and dissatisfaction."

However, some subplots like Paula's new phone call and the ambiguities in Sean's and Holden's future are left somewhat open-ended."
Valentine's Day,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The film follows a complex web of relationships centered around love on Valentine's Day, which effectively conveys multiple emotional responses, including joy and sadness. The audience becomes invested in the characters and their outcomes. The ending successfully ties up many story arcs, eliciting emotions and feeling earned. However, the lack of audience reaction data like reviews prevents a perfect score."
Valentine's Day,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"Major plot developments leading to the ending are effectively connected with cause-and-effect relationships such as Morley leaving Reed, leading to Reed starting a new relationship with Julia, and Sean coming out on television, leading to him reconnecting with Holden.

Valentine's Day,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The central theme of love and relationships is consistently presented throughout both the input and the actual output. The ending aligns well with these themes as characters find resolutions to their romantic struggles, such as Kate reuniting with her son and Edgar and Estelle reconciling. However, some subplots, like Paulaâ€™s response to the phone call, are less connected to the central themes."
Valentine's Day,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The ending subverts expectations logically with several intertwined resolutions (e.g. Kate's son Edison). Multiple foreshadowing clues support the twists like Sean's contemplation of his career and Liz's phone sex job. These add to the story's meaning. Reed moving on with Julia resolves his storyline well, while hints of reconciliation and progression are realized in other arcs."
Valentine's Day,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The film navigates through various romantic scenarios, typical of romantic comedies, and offers satisfying closures while challenging some genre conventions by focusing on more realistic resolutions rather than idealized romance.

Life During Wartime,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.8,"The plot evokes complex emotions such as sadness and shock, with characters experiencing significant struggles and emotional moments (e.g., Joy's visions, Timmy's bar mitzvah). The audience investment is strong due to complex and flawed characters. The emotional ending feels earned with the weighty issues addressed. It lacks audience reaction data like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb reviews."
Life During Wartime,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The actual output logically follows the events leading up to Timmy's bar mitzvah and maintains the established themes of seeking forgiveness and dealing with parental issues.

2012,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.9,"The main conflict of survival during global catastrophes is resolved with the safe arrival of the arks at the Cape of Good Hope. Subplots such as Jackson's family reconciliation and Adrian's new relationship have satisfying endings. The alternate ending provides additional closure with surviving passengers and Adrian's father's fate. While complete, the alternate ending adds some ambiguity with new discoveries."
2012,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The alternate ending provides additional closure and joy with the survival of Adrian's father. However, it lacks some emotional impact as the main story's dramatic events have already unfolded. Character investment remains high, even if audience reaction data isn't provided."
2012,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"Most major plot developments were consistent with cause-and-effect relationships.

2012,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The alternate ending aligns with the theme of survival and human resilience, symbolic elements like reuniting with loved ones reinforce the message, and audience takeaway is clear. Specific details such as finding Genesis survivors bolster the theme effectively."
2012,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The audience expected all characters on the ark to be the only survivors. The ending logically subverts this by revealing more survivors from the Genesis, supported by foreshadowing involving Adrian's father's survival. The twist adds to the theme of hope and human resilience."
2012,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,The original ending fits the disaster genre's typical structure of hope and rebuilding.

Drag Me to Hell,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.9,"The plot developments from the seance to the attempt of passing on the curse successfully lead to the tragic ending. Events follow a clear cause-and-effect sequence, with Christine trying and failing to lift the curse by returning the button. There are no major plot holes or inconsistencies. The ending ties back to the themes of fate and consequences of one's actions, and the character arcs conclude logically. The ending is coherent and logical, but the mix-up of the envelopes is a somewhat convenient twist."
Drag Me to Hell,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),1.0,The movieâ€™s central themes of consequences and karma align with the ending where Christineâ€™s attempts to escape punishment result in her being dragged to Hell.

Drag Me to Hell,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The initial story creates an expectation that Christine will escape her fate by facing various challenges, but the ending reveals that she cannot escape the curse, which is a logical yet unexpected twist.

Duplicity,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a spy thriller, typically ending with a twist.

A Perfect Getaway,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"Plot developments make sense, ending ties to character arcs and themes about identity, with slight improbability in Gina's sudden phone signal."
A Perfect Getaway,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The movie presents themes of trust and deception, which are well-aligned with the ending where the true identities of Cliff and Cydney are revealed. The symbolic elements, such as the teeth in the bag and the isolation of the hiking trail, reinforce the themes. The ending provides a clear takeaway with Cydney's confession and Cliff's death, but the narrative about Gina and Nick's future reduces the impact slightly."
A Perfect Getaway,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The twist logically subverts expectations set by the initial setup of a harmless honeymoon trip, with foreshadowing clues like the double murder and missing permits. The revelation of Cliff and Cydney's true identities adds depth and meaning, making the twist impactful."
A Perfect Getaway,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie is a thriller, and its ending fits the genre's convention of high tension and dramatic resolution.

 Madea Goes to Jail,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.8,"Main conflicts involving Madea's legal issues and Josh's relationship with Candace are clearly resolved. Subplots regarding Linda's deceit and Candace's redemption are also concluded. The ending is complete, with characters achieving closure, but lacks exploration of secondary characters' final outcomes."
 Madea Goes to Jail,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.7,"The ending successfully elicits emotions by unveiling Linda's deceit and freeing the wrongly convicted characters, creating both relief and joy. Character investment is strong, especially with Josh's emotional journey and Candace's redemption. Despite lacking direct audience reaction data, the resolution feels earned as it ties up key plot points."
 Madea Goes to Jail,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The plot developments and cause-effect relationships are mostly logical. Events such as Linda falsifying records and the public protest to overturn convictions follow a coherent sequence. However, Josh jilting Linda at the altar and immediately declaring love for Candace is somewhat abrupt, slightly affecting coherence and character arc consistency."
 Madea Goes to Jail,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.8,"The ending aligns with the central themes of forgiveness and redemption established throughout the movie. Symbolic elements like the class taught by Ellen reinforce the themes. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway of personal accountability and the impact of forgiveness. However, some secondary elements, like the anger management subplot with Madea, are not fully aligned with the primary themes."
 Madea Goes to Jail,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts expectations logically, revealing Linda's deceit during the wedding and leading to Candace's release. Foreshadowing and Josh's guilt about Candace's past support the twist. The twist adds meaning by allowing justice for wrongly convicted characters and setting up a hopeful future for Josh and Candace."
 Madea Goes to Jail,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie seems to follow the dramedy genre, typically ending with resolution and character growth, as shown by Madea, Candace, and Josh's arcs. The ending fits the genre conventions of redemption and justice but challenges expectations with a significant public protest element. The breaking of conventions by adding a public outcry enhances the film, showing societal impact. Audience expectations for justice and redemption appear to be met, but the storyline's complexity might slightly dampen the conventional simple resolution expected."
Miss March,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),1.0,"The main conflict of Eugene's struggle to find Cindi is resolved when they reconcile at the mansion.

Miss March,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.3,"The intended emotional response seems mixed between humor and shock, with some investment in characters like Eugene and Tucker. However, ending feels forced rather than genuinely earned. Reviews or audience reaction data not provided."
Miss March,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The plot developments leading to the ending are well-identified and logical. The cause-and-effect relationships are mostly clear, but a few events, like the involvement of Candace's brother, seem a bit forced. The ending aligns with character arcs and themes but contains slight inconsistencies, such as the abrupt resolution of the MPEG subplot."
Miss March,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.6,"While the ending does align with themes of friendship and overcoming obstacles, it partially contradicts the theme of abstinence since Eugene ultimately abandons his advocacy for abstinence. Symbolic elements such as the Playboy Mansion and Hugh Hefner's advice reinforce themes of desire and transformation. The audience gets a takeaway about friendship and staying true to oneself, but it could be clearer."
Miss March,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.6,"The ending addresses audience expectations by resolving Eugeneâ€™s and Tuckerâ€™s personal issues, subverts expectations with MPEG's secret and Cindi's financial support, but lacks strong foreshadowing for these twists."
Miss March,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.7,"The movie follows typical comedy genre conventions with slapstick humor and improbable scenarios.

Ninja Assassin,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The central themes of the movie, such as freedom and rebellion against oppression, are defined and the ending aligns well with these themes as Raizo recognizes his freedom. Symbolic elements, like the wall climb similar to Kiriko's, reinforce the meaning. The clear takeaway is Raizo's ultimate escape from the Ozunu's control. However, the reason for Mika's survival due to her heart's quirk feels slightly convenient and less thematic."
Ninja Assassin,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.8,"The ending subverts audience expectations logically by introducing an unpredictable twist where Mika's unique heart placement saves her. Raizo's use of 'shadow blending' and final freedom recognition add depth to the story. Foreshadowing is present with Raizo's evolving doubts and skills. Overall, it brings meaningful closure to his journey."
Ninja Assassin,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The ending fits the action genre conventions with Raizo defeating the primary antagonist in a climactic duel.

The movie ends on a complete note with Ronnie finding some romantic interest in Nell and regaining his job. However, some elements remain slightly ambiguous, such as Ronnieâ€™s overall state of mental health and his future with Nell."
 Observe and Report,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.6,"The input attempts to elicit emotions of shock and some dark humor through the chaotic behavior of Ronnie, but character investment is shallow due to the extreme and unrelatable actions. The ending feels somewhat earned but leans more on absurdity than genuine emotion."
 Observe and Report,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The plot developments leading to the ending are well connected and follow a logical sequence. Events such as Ronnieâ€™s confrontation with the drug dealers and the flasherâ€™s final exposure make sense. There are no significant plot holes, although some character actions and their resolutions, like Dennisâ€™s escape to Mexico, might seem slightly abrupt. The ending aligns with the theme of Ronnieâ€™s misguided heroism and exhibits character growth, especially in his rejection of Brandi and his ultimate triumph."
 Observe and Report,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.7,"The central theme of the movie is about Ronnie's misguided quest for heroism and validation. The ending aligns with this theme as Ronnie ultimately captures the flasher and asserts his self-worth without needing official authority, symbolized by rejecting a badge or gun. Symbolic elements such as the slow-motion chase and the coffee brought by Nell reinforce the central theme of personal redemption. However, there are inconsistencies like the unnecessary violence and bigoted behavior, which might leave the audience with mixed feelings rather than a clear takeaway."
 Observe and Report,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The ending subverts expectations by having Ronnie ultimately capture the flasher, despite his many flaws and setbacks. There are foreshadowing clues in his commitment to catching the criminal and mentioned use of a gun. The twist adds meaning to the story by showing Ronnie's determination and growth. However, some actions, like shooting the flasher, strain believability."
 Observe and Report,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.6,"The genre appears to be dark comedy with elements of drama. The ending challenges conventions by having the unstable protagonist achieve a form of success through unorthodox means, which may enhance the genre's unpredictable nature but might not align with audience expectations for a resolution.

Whatever Works,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The movie's themes of cynical adaptation and personal transformation are well-defined and conclude with characters finding happiness in new relationships, reinforcing the theme 'whatever works'. Symbolic elements like Boris communicating directly to the audience reinforce this theme effectively, leaving the audience with clear takeaways."

Doubt,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),1.0,"The central theme of doubt is reinforced throughout the story, from Father Flynn's initial sermon to Sister Aloysius' climactic breakdown. Symbolic elements like the smell of alcohol and the shirt in the locker reinforce the suspicion and doubt. The audience leaves with a clear takeaway on the complexity and ambiguity of doubt."
Doubt,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"Father Flynn's promotion subverts audience expectations logically by demonstrating church politics despite suspicion. Aloysius's lie and her final doubt tie into the sermon on doubt, adding deeper meaning to the story. The foreshadowing and twists are well-supported."
Doubt,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The movie 'Doubt' is a drama and follows a psychological thriller structure. The ending fits the genre conventions by leaving ambiguity and focusing on internal conflict.

Bangkok Dangerous,Closure & Resolution âœ… (GEval),0.7,"The alternate ending presents a clear conclusion and resolves the main conflict with Joe fleeing and Kong avenging him. However, it slightly deviates from Joe's original character traits and leaves some subplots like Joe's relationship with Fon less resolved."
Bangkok Dangerous,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.6,"The alternate ending reduces the intended emotional impact by allowing Joe to survive instead of making the sacrifice, which lessens audience investment in his character arc. It also offers a less emotionally effective conclusion, justifying only a mid-level emotional score without substantial audience reaction data."
Bangkok Dangerous,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.7,"The alternate ending changes a major plot development where Joe doesn't die, altering the original cause-and-effect relationship and thematic closure. However, the rest of the events remain mostly consistent and logical."
Bangkok Dangerous,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.6,"The central themes of professionalism and solitude are somewhat aligned but not fully reinforced in the alternate ending. Joe's decision to kill himself to protect Kong underscores his mentorship and transformation, which is partly symbolic, but Kong's rescue and the villagers' appreciation dilute the focus on Joe's ultimate sacrifice and resolution."
Bangkok Dangerous,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.7,"The alternate ending provides a logical twist where Kong saves Joe, a deviation from the original sacrificial ending. There is foreshadowing with Joe mentoring Kong, and the twist adds meaning by showing Kong's growth. However, the twist could have been more surprising."
Bangkok Dangerous,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.7,"The genre of the movie is action-thriller and typically includes intense endings with confrontations and resolutions. The original ending fits this genre well by delivering a dramatic climax where the protagonist sacrifices himself, fulfilling audience expectations for closure and a moral decision.

Burn After Reading,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The major plot developments and cause-and-effect relationships are well tracked, with events making logical sense and tying back to character motivations and the convoluted nature of the plot.

Burn After Reading,Thematic Payoff ðŸŽ¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending aligns with the central themes of confusion, incompetence, and futility, and reinforces these themes through symbolic elements like the CIA's missteps and the characters' misunderstandings. The audience is left with a clear takeaway about the absurdity of the characters' actions and the lack of meaningful consequences, though the director's comment at the end slightly lessens the impact."
Burn After Reading,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The ending subverts expectations logically by resolving multiple character arcs unexpectedly, aligning with the evil of the CIA's bureaucracy. There are foreshadowed clues like Harry's paranoia and Linda's desperation that support this twist. The twist adds meaning by highlighting absurdity in intelligence operations."
Burn After Reading,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.9,"The plot revolves around espionage and dark comedy, typical for a dark comedy film and its genre conventions.

The ending is complete with Sinclair being accepted as the new leader of Sol's gang, but there's some ambiguity regarding the future."
Doomsday,Emotional Impact ðŸŽ­ (GEval),0.6,"The story presents elements of a dystopian scenario, but the emotional response is inconsistent. While the build-up of Sinclair's mission and the personal investment in her character are clear, the ending with Sinclair becoming the leader of the marauders feels abrupt and less effective. The resolution of Canaris' plan being exposed is somewhat satisfying but lacks emotional depth."
Doomsday,Narrative Coherence & Logic ðŸ”— (GEval),0.8,"The plot developments and cause-and-effect relationships are generally logical, with clear motivations for characters like Sinclair and Canaris. There are no major plot holes, and the ending ties back to the themes of survival and power struggles. However, the sudden integration of Sinclair as the new leader of Sol's gang feels slightly rushed and less developed."

The twist adds depth to the story, but Sinclair becoming the gang leader might feel abrupt."
Doomsday,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.8,"The movie's genre, an action-thriller with dystopian elements, typically ends with a climactic confrontation and a shift in power. The ending fits genre conventions by depicting a high-stakes revelation and a change in leadership (Sinclair becoming the new leader). Breaking minor conventions by having a protagonist stay behind adds unique depth and plausibility, which enhances the film. Audience expectations of a dramatic and violent resolution are met well."

The ending involves addressing these themes, as Ray and Franny confront the corruption directly.

The audience gets a clear takeaway about accountability, though the focus on the violent conclusion and street justice detracts slightly from the alignment with the central themes."
Pride and Glory,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.6,"The ending attempts to subvert expectations by having Ray confront Jimmy and the ensuing crowd conflict, but it lacks sufficient foreshadowing and does not fully tie back to earlier narrative threads, such as the internal family conflict detailed in the Input."
Pride and Glory,Genre Alignment ðŸŽž (GEval),0.7,"The genre is police drama, which often ends with resolution of crime and depicting moral complexities. The actual output fits the genre conventions with resolution but adds a twist with a morally complex ending where Jimmy is beaten to death by a crowd.

The audience is left with a clear takeaway about the protagonist's redemption and the impact of his sacrifices.
Seven Pounds,Surprise Factor ðŸ¤¯ (GEval),0.9,"The film sets up audience expectations with Tim posing as Ben and giving reasons for his actions unknown initially. The ending logically subverts these expectations when Tim donates his heart to Emily after his suicide.
